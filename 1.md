Getting started in Haskell is surprisingly easy! As usual, many examples here are taken from *Learn you a Haskell*. 

- GHCi is installed as soon as you `apt install ghc`.
- `2 + 15` works as expected in GHCi, as do parens and order of operations.
- Bool arithmetic works the same way as in other languages.
- `==` is for testing equality and `/=` is not-equal.
- Functions like `succ` (successor), `min`, and `max` all support multiple data types, like ints and floats
- Functions are defined like this: `halfMe x = x / 2`
- If statements look like this: 
```haskell
x = if x > 100
	then x
	else x*2
```
- On these if statements, the `else` part is required because every function must return something. 
- The `'` symbol is perfectly okay in function names. 
- In GHCi, you can use the `let` keyword to define something right away without having to save it to a file and use the `:l something` command. 
- Lists look just like they do in Python. 
- Strings are lists of chars, as in C. 
- The `++` operator is used for concatenation on lists and strings. 
- The `:` operator adds something to the front of a list, faster than adding something to the back of the list with `++`. 
- `++` takes two lists and `:` takes a number or char and a list (maybe other data types too?). 
- `!!` gets an element from a list like this: `"hello world" !! 4` returns `o`. 
- Lists can be nested. 
- The commands `head`, `tail`, `last`, and `init` take different parts of the list and return them. See [this diagram](http://s3.amazonaws.com/lyah/listmonster.png).
- `length` is obvious, `null` sees if a list is empty, `reverse` reverses lists, `take` extracts a number of elements from the start of a list, `drop` removes a number of elements from the beginning of a list, `maximum` and `minimum` work as expected, as do `sum` and `product`, and `elem` tells you if something is an element of a list. 
- A range can be written like this: `[1..20]` where every number between 1 and 20 is in the list. This works with chars too. 
- `[2,4..20]` counts by two, as expected. 
- `[1..]` makes an infinite list. 
- `cycle` makes a list into an infinite list by repeating it over and over. `repeat` makes an infinite list of one element over and over. `replicate 3 20` is simpler, though, and returns `[20,20,20]`.  
- List comprehensions are basically things that take a list of numbers and do something to them. 
- The basic syntax for a list comprehension is as follows: `[x*2 | x <- [1..10]]`. This one takes all the numbers from 1 to 10 and multiplies them by 2. 
- List comprehensions can also include a predicate, where the syntax for a function that gets all of the numbers from 50 to 100 whose remainder when divided by 7 is 3 (taken directly from *Learn you a Haskell*) is ``[ x | x <- [50..100], x `mod` 7 == 3]``. 
- The predicate is "checked" before the items are added to the list. 
- Notice that the `mod` function in backticks makes it go from a prefix function to an infix function. To do the opposite, you can put an infix function in parens to make it into a prefix function. 
- Tuples are just like lists, but they can be made up of a number of different types of variables, unlike lists (which must be all the same type). 
- Lists of tuples and tuples of lists work just fine. 
- The functions `fst` and `snd` take the frst and second elements of a tuple. They only work on pair tuples. 
- `zip` joins matching elements in two lists into pairs by their position in the lists. (`zip [1,2,3,4,5] [1,1,1,1,1]` returns `[(1,1),(2,1)])` and so on. 
- You can `zip` lists with different numbers of elements; only the ones that match will be used in the output list.
