Getting started in Haskell is surprisingly easy! As usual, many examples here are taken from *Learn you a Haskell*. 

- GHCi is installed as soon as you `apt install ghc`.
- `2 + 15` works as expected in GHCi, as do parens and order of operations.
- Bool arithmetic works the same way as in other languages.
- `==` is for testing equality and `/=` is not-equal.
- Functions like `succ` (successor), `min`, and `max` all support multiple data types, like ints and floats
- Functions are defined like this: `halfMe x = x / 2`
- If statements look like this: 
```haskell
x = if x > 100
	then x
	else x*2
```
- On these if statements, the `else` part is required because every function must return something. 
- The `'` symbol is perfectly okay in function names. 
- In GHCi, you can use the `let` keyword to define something right away without having to save it to a file and use the `:l something` command. 
- Lists look just like they do in Python. 
- Strings are lists of chars, as in C. 
- The `++` operator is used for concatenation on lists and strings. 
- The `:` operator adds something to the front of a list, faster than adding something to the back of the list with `++`. 
- `++` takes two lists and `:` takes a number or char and a list (maybe other data types too?). 
- `!!` gets an element from a list like this: `"hello world" !! 4` returns `o`. 
- Lists can be nested. 
- The commands `head`, `tail`, `last`, and `init` take different parts of the list and return them. See [this diagram](http://s3.amazonaws.com/lyah/listmonster.png).
- `length` is obvious, `null` sees if a list is empty, `reverse` reverses lists, `take` extracts a number of elements from the start of a list, `drop` removes a number of elements from the beginning of a list, `maximum` and `minimum` work as expected, as do `sum` and `product`, and `elem` tells you if something is an element of a list. 
- A range can be written like this: `[1..20]` where every number between 1 and 20 is in the list. This works with chars too. 
- `[2,4..20]` counts by two, as expected. 
- `[1..]` makes an infinite list. 
- `cycle` makes a list into an infinite list by repeating it over and over. `repeat` makes an infinite list of one element over and over. `replicate 3 20` is simpler, though, and returns `[20,20,20].  
- List comprehensions are basically a things that take a list of numbers and do something to them.
